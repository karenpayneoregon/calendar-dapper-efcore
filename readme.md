## EF Core 8 and Dapper example: calendar examples

A repository for working example using Dapper and EF Core for working with a calendar database.

Currently there are only two code samples for each EF Core and Dapper and each has the exact same samples.

More to follow as it take time to mirror both methods for each EF Core and Dapper.

:heavy_check_mark: Database contains USA holidays from 2000 to 2099.
